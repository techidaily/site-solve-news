_Partners create new cloud-based service for anytime, anywhere document translation_

ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, today announced it has executed a trademark license agreement with Xerox. As an initial result of their collaboration with ABBYY, Xerox has introduced the [Xerox® Easy Translator Service](http://www.xeroxtranslates.com), the industry’s first cloud-enabled language translation solution integrated via a web portal across Xerox® devices built on ConnectKey® technology, as well as mobile devices and desktops.

Xerox and ABBYY developed the translation services that combine language translation technologies from [ABBYY Language Solutions (LS)](http://www.abbyy-ls.com/) and a large group of professional language consultants and subject matter experts. These services are integrated with best-in-its-class ABBYY OCR and capture technology, to maintain the original formatting of translated documents.

“Improving translation is at the core of enterprise transformation and global connections. This licensing agreement and initial offers are distinct because we combine Xerox’s expertise in document workflow technologies with an innovator in translation solutions in ABBYY,” said Bertrand Cerisier, vice president, global marketing, Office Solutions Business Group, Xerox. “Through the use of MFPs, smartphones and a cloud infrastructure, we’re bringing an innovative capacity for localization to organizations both large and small and in all countries“

“Xerox is providing a model of innovation,” said Dean Tang, president and CEO, ABBYY (NAHQ). “We look forward to working together on future solutions that set the highest standards for companies doing business around the globe.”

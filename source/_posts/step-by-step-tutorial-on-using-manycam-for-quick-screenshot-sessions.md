## Step-by-Step Tutorial on Using ManyCam for Quick Screenshot Sessions

## Take a ManyCam Snapshot

For best performance please follow these recommendations:

* Make sure the background has no moving objects or lighting changes.
* If possible make the background as plain as possible and try to have contrast between the background and your face/body.
* Do not move your webcam after you take the snapshot. If you move your webcam you'll need to take a new snapshot.
* Turn OFF all automatic settings on your camera such as auto exposure, auto white balance, auto gain and zooming/panning options. Activate "anti-flicker" in your webcam settings if possible. You can access these settings via the software that came with webcam or go to the "sources" window in ManyCam and choose "Properties".

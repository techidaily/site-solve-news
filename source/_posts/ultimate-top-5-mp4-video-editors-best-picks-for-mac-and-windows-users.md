## What Is the Best MP4 Video Processing Software?

**1\. Does It Accept the Source MP4 Video?**

Mostly, popular iPhone, GoPro, DJi Drone, Canon EOS, Nikon DSLR, etc record videos in MP4 H.264 while the latest models such as iPhone X, GoPro Hero 6, DJI P4P adopt [HEVC codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for smaller space occupation. The former is a supported codec in most software by default. But when the MP4 footage comes with an aspect ratio or frame rate that cannot fit the editors like iMovie, it will reject the MP4 video. Worse still, there are still a great many [free video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that is powerless to handle HEVC or other obscure codecs. This is decisive where you can successfully import the MP4 video to your program for editing.

But a good MP4 video editor features the most basic features and enables all process with a minimum of fuss.

**4\. Does It Has the Most Basic Editing Features?**

What are the most essential features when it comes to video editing?

* **Cut/trim:** Cutting video helps to capture the essence and cut out the unwanted sections. In the meantime, this will [reduce the size of video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) especially when many online sites impose file size restriction. Note: videos no longer than 1 minute get the most attention on Facebook according to expert.
* **Crop video:** Watching a video with letterboxes or black bars can be distracting. Cropping the video to better suit your device screen or social media sites is a premium choice.
* **Apply effects:** Effects, aka, filters, enhance the video quality. The capability of adding effects to your video is preferred. But the general rule is to keep things to a bare minimum. Too many effects can distract you.
* **Split & Merge:** If the video is too long, you need to extract specific scenes and combine them together to upload to internet (e.g. to YouTube). Note: some mp4 video editors only work when the files have the same format. You'd better choose the one built in converting feature.
* **Add Subtitles:** Subtitle is especially helpful when you start a YouTube channel or so. It is of great important to make sure your viewers get the message, improve comprehension, and increase video social reach by [adding subtitles to a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

**5\. It should be able to edit MP4 videos without re-encoding**

The are many tools that offers the features to split, trim or crop MP4 videos. But there is no option to edit the video without re-encoding.

## Reasons to Partition Your Mac

We can benefit a lot from partitioning your Mac's hard drive. Look at our list of advantages of creating different volumes on Mac. 

* Add a new hard drive partition on mac to run multiple OS or different OS versions, for example, Windows, macOS High Sierra.
* Using Boot Camp built into Mac requires partitioning hard drive on Mac, which allows installing Windows on the separate partition without [Mac superdrive](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
* If you have many types of backup, such as a huge collection of [DVDs backup on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), Android iPad iPhone file backup, you can partition a hard drive on Mac to store these backups on different partitions and manage them more easily and efficiently.

##  Disadvantages of partitioning a hard drive on Mac

Dividing Mac hard drive into different partitions is not always a good thing. You'd better check out these disadvantages you are facing before you decide to create a new partition on your Mac's hard drive. 

* Reduced storage space. Some space gets lost if you have more than one partition. It's common that you do have free space on the hard drive, but there's no enough space left on these partitions. However, this is not a big problem as storage is cheaper today.
* Slow and inconvenient data transfer. It will take longer time to copy data from one partition to another.
* Partitioning doesn't make much sense if the hard drive has small capacity.

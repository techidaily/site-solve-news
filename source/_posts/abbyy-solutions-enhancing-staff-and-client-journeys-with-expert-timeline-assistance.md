* ABBYY Timeline identifies automation opportunities 80% faster and speeds process redesign by 30% to improve employee and customer experiences.
* Process simulation capabilities ensure improvement investments deliver expected outcomes to maintain a competitive advantage.
* Task mining capabilities seamlessly integrate with process mining to deliver more comprehensive insights into employee engagements for more proactive process improvements.
* Redesigned user experience addresses the industry shift from process intelligence used by specialized analysts to business users to enable highest-value analysis and productivity.

Organizations can now achieve the highest levels of operational excellence that improve employee productivity and customer experiences while accelerating profitability goals with [ABBYY Timeline 6.0](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). Recognized as a leader in process mining by NelsonHall, ISG, Zinnov Zones, Quadrant Knowledge Solutions, and GigaOm, Timeline identifies automation opportunities and builds new optimized processes up to 80% faster.

"Our relationship with ABBYY has assisted us in helping our clients visualizing business processes like they’ve never seen them before—the insights, bottlenecks and recommended primary paths are visually revealed dynamically, plus we can segment by data, process and person, enabling us to help clients to become more efficient and effective.   
  
We are finding process and task mining provides our clients with a significant competitive advantage and improved profitability by standardizing and accelerating intelligent automation initiatives."

_Richard Davis, management consulting business and technology transformation partner with RSM US LLP_

ABBYY Timeline uniquely offers a unified platform that includes process mining, task mining, and [process simulation](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). This level of comprehensive process intelligence provides a true understanding of how an organization works, with insights into how people and data interact within systems, and the confidence that intelligent automation investments are delivering the expected outcomes. Of utmost importance, leaders gain the knowledge of how process improvements are impacting customers with dynamic, real-time dashboards.

"Process mining is proving to be an effective tool for organizations improving operational efficiency. Yet combined with task mining, leaders have a more comprehensive understanding of how staff impact customer outcomes.   
  
An emerging capability is process simulation, which will be powerful in predicting how variables in resources could either increase unnecessary costs or accelerate performance goals."

_Maureen Fleming, Program Vice President for Intelligent Process Automation at IDC._

Timeline is a necessary tool for organizations trying to increase market share and gain a competitive advantage. By using this solution, users ranging from specialized Six Sigma analysts to line-of-business managers can more quickly identify blind spots within business-critical processes such as invoice processing, onboarding customers, call centers, patient workflow and any other processes that are complex and have highly variable sets of conditions.

IDC affirmed the growing use of process mining and stated it was the highest growing subset of the intelligent process automation market with a 2022-2026 CAGR of 50.5% and revenues reaching $3.0 billion in 20261.

"Today’s business leader needs to be able to identify and quickly take action on ways they can strategically and thoughtfully reduce unnecessary costs yet enable growth opportunities.  
  
Timeline provides our customers with business relevant insights uniquely available from a unified platform that encompasses both task mining and process mining with the additional predictive analytics from process simulation. Having this data in real time empowers leaders to focus intelligent automation efforts on revenue-generating business processes that increase profitability and improve customers’ experiences."

_Scott Opitz, CTO/CPO at ABBYY._

Timeline also augments Vantage, ABBYY’s cloud-based low-code/no-code intelligent document processing platform. Timeline’s new data warehouse into [ABBYY Vantage](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) delivers the best of two worlds – process intelligence and intelligent document processing. Combined together, they deliver significantly more value to the customer by giving them better understanding of their document-centric processes, thereby getting the most value from critical data trapped in documents and ensuring processes perform as expected and adapt to changing requirements.

### By partnering with global customers, the company will plant nearly 2000 trees per year.

ABBYY, a Digital Intelligence company, today announced a commitment to plant thousands of trees a year to support its environmental policy and meet new goals in line with its corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. The initiative corresponds with the company’s ability to help organizations go paperless and improve processes through digital transformation. ABBYY has partnered with a nonprofit organization One Tree Planted that plants saplings around the world to help combat climate change, conserve biodiversity, restore landscapes, and strengthen communities. One Tree Planted partners with global companies Facebook, HP, adidas and dozens of others.

ABBYY has committed to donate a tree for every new customer of ABBYY Digital Intelligence solutions since the beginning of 2021 and has already secured planting for 410 trees globally. Customers eligible for the ABBYY Plant a Tree campaign are given a choice of where they would like their tree planted within North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia.

We are actively developing our CSR initiatives and the new Plant a Tree project was very much favored by our international team spread across 14 countries, and also aligns with how we help organizations go paperless and improve processes. According to our forecast, we will be ready to plant no less than 2,000 trees a year, and this equates to restoring more than four acres of land into forests. The impact is enormous in terms of improving soil and water conservation, controlling local climate by providing shade, regulating temperature extremes, increasing wildlife habitat and improving the land's capacity to adapt to climate change. With the growing importance of dealing with environmental challenges and climate change, we are honored to be contributing to this cause

_Weronika Niemczyk, Chief People Officer at ABBYY_

According to the UN [Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 report](http://www.fao.org/3/ca9825en/ca9825en.pdf "Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 report PDF"), in 2015–2020, the annual rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares. In 2020, One Tree Planted secured donations enough to plant over 10 million trees, which equals to over 30 000 hectares.
